# Ano DSP Library

This is a DSP libary by Anoesis Audio, written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), and intended to run on embedded and desktop.

## Some Rust stuff

### Starting a new library

```zsh
cargo new ano_dsp_lib --lib
```


### Compiling and Testing

To check the code prior to compiling, use ```cargo check```.

Since this is a library, there is nothing to run. Using ```cargo test``` rather than ```cargo run``` will work.




Write a dsp gain control that processes by blocks or single samples in python with linear interpolation and pytest tests (including conftest).

Show how to create a rust library (edition = "2024") that implements the same algorithm and tests in a library called "fun_with_rust".
